The goal of this project is to record the temperature in my room on a regular interval, so that it may be compared to the temperature outside.

`temperaturesensor.ino` is example code pulled directly from [Github.com/eliteio](https://github.com/eliteio/DS18B20). It will eventually be modified to send the data to a server of my choosing.
